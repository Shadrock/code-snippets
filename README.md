# Code Snippets
This is a repo that I used to:
- store bits and pieces of code I find helpful, and 
- demonstrate the amazing value of Markdown for Github repos. 

## Some Examples
If this was a really amazing README, quote somebody who said:
> Wow, amazing repo. 

I might also need to **bold something**, *italicize something*, or ~~have stricken text strike~~ something out to show an edit or mistake. 

## Adding Images
There's a very helpful [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=hHbWF1Bvgf4) for this if we don't get to it in class. 
1. Choose the image you want to use and give it a name that **does not use spaces!** So, "Scary_Shadrack_1803_1878.png" is fine but "Scary Shadrack 1803 1878.png" is not. 
2. Create a new folder in your repo and give it a good name like "images".
