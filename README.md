# Code Snippets
This is a repo that I used to:
- store bits and pieces of code I find helpful, and 
- demonstrate the amazing value of Markdown for Github repos. 

## Some Examples
If this was a really amazing README, quote somebody who said:
> Wow, amazing repo. 

I might also need to **bold something**, *italicize something*, or ~~have stricken text strike~~ something out to show an edit or mistake.
